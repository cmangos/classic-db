-- CMaNGOS custom DB updates
-- -------------------------------

-- This file holds SQL updates to DB contents that are known to be different from official/sniff data
-- These updates are applied to ensure expected functionning from a gameplay point of view
-- (aka "Blizzlike") when using CMaNGOS core.
--
-- These updates SHOULD NOT be part of a full DB dump (like for DB release) or inserted into a regular 
-- SQL update file as we need to keep DB data as "pure" as possible to analyse them and
-- deduce proper core behaviour from them.
-- 
-- Possible but non-exhaustive reasons for these updates to be needed:
--	- CMaNGOS core does not properly handle the data these updates are fixing (yet)
--	- Official/sniff data are from a different expansion/patch and were possibly changed since Classic
--	- Official/sniff data from client are different from what they are server-side
--	- Data or their parsing were wrong
